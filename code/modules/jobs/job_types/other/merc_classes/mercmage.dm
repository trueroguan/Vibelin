	You're a noble, but in name only. You were taught in magic from an early age, but it wasn't enough. \
	You lost your wealth, taken away by force or spent carelessly by your family. \
	Either way, the result is the same. Your family fortune is gone, and you have become a mercenary to make ends meet. \
	It was gruelling, certainly difficult, but you're now a seasoned mage who can handle themselves during combat. \
	You have the scars and the arcyne prowess to prove it, after all.\
	\n\n\ \
	Yet after all this, you still think to yourself, that this work is beneath you, as your sense of pride protests every morning. \
