	Carvings of rock are replaced with holy tenets of caustic minerals and pools of acid, \
	those who fail were too weak and those who succeed are the next generation.\
	\n\n\
	Following a now twisted version of Pestran teachings, most worship the Wurm, \
	turning medicine into madness and plague into purity.\
	\n\n\
	Rituals of flesh searing and caustic air have turned them green, the deepest \
	hues showing the most devout.\
	\n\n\
	There are some who find their way out of their stone cages. Those fortunate to wander into humen \
	settlements, live just like their unscarred kin. Yet still remembering their old tenets, \
	they may never see Pestra the same."
